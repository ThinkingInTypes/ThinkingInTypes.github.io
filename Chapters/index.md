# Thinking in Types

> by Bruce Eckel

## Building Stubbornly Resilient Python Code

> This is a work in progress.
> A lot of the material is rough and in early form, especially the prose.
> However, the book development tooling is in place, so all the examples are tested
> (If something doesn't work, please [report it](https://github.com/ThinkingInTypes/ThinkingInTypes_Examples/issues)).
> My hope is that even during development, you will find the material useful.
