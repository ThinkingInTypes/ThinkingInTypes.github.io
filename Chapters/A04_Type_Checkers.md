## Getting Started with `mypy`: Installation and Basic Use

`mypy` is a popular static type checker for Python that validates type annotations:

### Installation

```bash
pip install mypy
```

### Basic Use

Run `mypy` on your script or module to identify type errors:

```bash
mypy your_script.py
```

Example:

```python
# script.py


def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"


# Incorrect type:
print(greet(123))  # type: ignore
## Hello, 123!
```

Running `mypy script.py` outputs:

```bash
script.py:4: error: Argument 1 to "greet" has incompatible type "int"; expected "str"
```

## Advanced Configuration and Fine-tuning of `mypy`

Customize `mypy` behavior using a `mypy.ini` or `pyproject.toml` file:

### Example `mypy.ini`

```ini
[mypy]
ignore_missing_imports = True
strict = True
check_untyped_defs = True
```

### Example `pyproject.toml`

```toml
[tool.mypy]
ignore_missing_imports = true
strict = true
```

Advanced configuration allows precise control over type-checking behavior and strictness levels.

## Exploring `pyright` and IDE Integration (VSCode, PyCharm)

`pyright`, developed by Microsoft, offers high-performance static type checking, integrated seamlessly with popular IDEs.

### Using `pyright` (CLI)

Install globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g pyright
pyright your_script.py
```

### VSCode Integration

`pyright` powers VSCode's built-in Python type checking, providing immediate feedback:

- Install the Python extension in VSCode.
- Real-time inline error highlighting and suggestions.

### PyCharm Integration

PyCharm supports built-in type checking:

- Provides live error detection, highlighting, and quick-fix suggestions.
- Navigate to `Preferences > Editor > Inspections` to configure type-checking rules.

## Incremental Typing Strategies: Gradual Adoption

Adopt typing gradually, focusing first on critical paths:

- Annotate high-risk or frequently changing modules first.
- Enable type checking incrementally to avoid overwhelming your team:

```ini
[mypy]
files = core/, utils/
```

Incremental typing balances immediate benefits with manageable adoption efforts.

## Integrating Type Checking into Continuous Integration

Automate type checking within your CI/CD pipeline to enforce consistency and catch errors early:

### Example GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: Type Check

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  type-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v3
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'

      - run: pip install mypy
      - run: mypy .
```

Automated checks ensure ongoing compliance with typing standards and maintain high code quality.

## Handling and Resolving Common Errors

Common type-checking errors and their resolutions:

### Incorrect Type Annotation

```python
# example_2.py
# Error: Incompatible types in assignment
# (expression has type "int", variable has type "str")
name: str = 123  # type: ignore
```

### Missing Imports

Use `ignore_missing_imports` or install type stubs:

```ini
[mypy]
ignore_missing_imports = True
```

Or install stubs:

```bash
pip install types-requests
```

### Union and Optional Errors

Resolve ambiguity clearly:

```python
# example_3.py
from typing import Optional


# Error: Incompatible return value type (got "None", expected "int")
def find_index(
    item: str, items: list[str]
) -> Optional[int]:
    try:
        return items.index(item)
    except ValueError:
        return None
```

Effectively handling and resolving these errors leads to clearer, more reliable, and maintainable codebases.
