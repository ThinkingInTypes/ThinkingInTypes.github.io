| **Annotation**       | Explicit type declaration for variables, functions, or classes.            |
| **Duck Typing**      | Determining an object's suitability based on presence of methods/attributes|
| **Generics**         | Type annotations parameterized by type variables.                          |
| **Literal Types**    | Types representing specific literal values.                                |
| **Protocol**         | Interface defined by structural compatibility, rather than explicit inheritance.|
| **Stub Files**       | Files (`.pyi`) containing type annotations without implementations.        |
| **Type Alias**       | Simplified or descriptive alias for complex type annotations.              |
| **Type Checking**    | Verification of type consistency either statically or at runtime.          |
| **Type Narrowing**   | Refining variable types within specific control-flow branches.             |
| **Variance**         | Rules describing subtype relationships between generic types (covariant, contravariant).|
| **Static Typing**    | Types checked before execution (compile-time).                             |
| **Dynamic Typing**   | Types determined and checked during execution (runtime).                   |
| **Covariance**       | Generic type that accepts subtypes as substitutes for its type parameter.  |
| **Contravariance**   | Generic type that accepts supertypes as substitutes for its type parameter.|
| **Invariant**        | Generic type that requires exact type matches for its type parameters.     |
