| Term               | Definition                                                                               |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Annotation**     | Explicit type declaration for variables, functions, or classes.                          |
| **Duck Typing**    | Determining an object's suitability based on presence of methods/attributes              |
| **Generics**       | Type annotations parameterized by type variables.                                        |
| **Literal Types**  | Types representing specific literal values.                                              |
| **Protocol**       | Interface defined by structural compatibility, rather than explicit inheritance.         |
| **Stub Files**     | Files (`.pyi`) containing type annotations without implementations.                      |
| **Type Alias**     | Simplified or descriptive alias for complex type annotations.                            |
| **Type Checking**  | Verification of type consistency either statically or at runtime.                        |
| **Type Narrowing** | Refining variable types within specific control-flow branches.                           |
| **Variance**       | Rules describing subtype relationships between generic types (covariant, contravariant). |
| **Static Typing**  | Types checked before execution (compile-time).                                           |
| **Dynamic Typing** | Types determined and checked during execution (runtime).                                 |
| **Covariance**     | Generic type that accepts subtypes as substitutes for its type parameter.                |
| **Contravariance** | Generic type that accepts supertypes as substitutes for its type parameter.              |
| **Invariant**      | Generic type that requires exact type matches for its type parameters.                   |
