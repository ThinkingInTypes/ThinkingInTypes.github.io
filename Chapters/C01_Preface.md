## Acknowledgements

Most of the understanding I needed to explain this topic came from my attempts to help on the book by Bill Frasure and James Ward, titled "Effect-Oriented Programming," that we worked on for over four years.
Iâ€™ve also learned a lot from some of the interviews that James and I have done for the [Happy Path Programming podcast](https://happypathprogramming.com/).
