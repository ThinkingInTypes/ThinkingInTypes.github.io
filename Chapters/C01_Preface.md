# Preface

## Strong Typing vs. Strong Testing

## Tight vs. Permissive Type Systems

## Why am I creating this book "in the open"?

- Thinking in C++ and Thinking in Java
- A "Business Model" can be about more than just money
- My goal is to create experiences. I'm not sure what form they might take, but perhaps it will be helping teams design types and architect their software.

## Yes, I Used AI

This is the first book I've written with AI, and it's been massively helpful.
I've used it every way that I can.
It has dramatically sped up the development of the book.
AI has been a tremendously useful assistant, far better than what we've had in the past, but:

1. I've still had to come up with the questions.
2. I've had to check, correct, and rewrite _everything_ it's produced.

So I've been as lazy as I've been able to achieve with this book, and I've been able to produce it faster.
But as with any book, I've developed a deep understanding of the topic by writing the book.
And if I've "cheated" by using AI, well, you can use the book for free, so it doesn't bother me (there are also ways to pay for it if you want).

The Jevons Paradox, named after the English economist William Stanley Jevons, who identified it in 1865.
Jevons observed that as coal use became more efficient—particularly with the invention of the Watt steam engine.
Coal consumption increased rather than decreased.
Increased efficiency in using a resource tends to increase (rather than decrease) the total consumption of that resource.
As AI makes programmers more efficient in creating systems, the demand for programmers will increase.

I used to have a bookcase full of computer programming books.
Then it became much easier to search the internet for answers than look in books.
Eventually I got rid of most of my books.
It's now become much easier to ask questions of an AI and have it generate examples and prose (although both must be rewritten).
So I will tend to use AI more than other resources, still verifying as I did with those other resources.
Using the AI has taught me to be better at asking questions, and I hope this book might do the same for you.

I've enjoyed writing books, but perhaps because of AI, this will be my last one.
Perhaps I will hand over the teaching of programming to AI.
If that happens, it means that I will have moved on to building tools for programmers and building systems for non-programmers.
Ultimately, that will be more useful than writing books about programming.
If that happens, I look forward to it.

## Acknowledgements

Most of the understanding I needed to explain this topic came from my attempts to help on the book by Bill Frasure and James Ward, titled "Effect-Oriented Programming," that we worked on for over four years.
I’ve also learned a lot from some of the interviews that James and I have done for the [Happy Path Programming podcast](https://happypathprogramming.com/).
