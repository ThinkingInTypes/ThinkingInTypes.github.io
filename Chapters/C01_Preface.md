# Preface

## Strong Typing vs. Strong Testing

## Tight vs. Permissive Type Systems

## Why is This Book Free?

When I began writing about programming, there were user manuals, but these weren't very good.
Magazine articles and books were the primary way people found information.
The demand was high, so it was relatively easy to become a book author.
I'm sure I could have made a lot more money in computing in some other way, but:

1. I enjoyed the process of discovery and of writing about it.
2. I had convinced myself that this was a good path to becoming a consultant.

Many years later, I've come to ponder point two and realized that I had jumped to a convenient conclusion based on point one.
If I was starting out now to pursue consulting, I would instead ask a lot of questions, probably starting with an AI.
I would then talk to individual consultants and small consulting firms, and maybe even work for one.
Most importantly, I would try to get to the bottom of _why_ I wanted to be a consultant; what need does it satisfy (other than making a living).

In my case the "why" is the need for connection and community and the need to be helpful.
In the last 15 years I've studied this thing called _Nonviolent Communication_ (NVC) and taken a lot of enjoyable workshops on the subject.
After becoming better at communicating, the biggest benefit of NVC is discovering your true needs.
Once you know those, you can distinguish between needs and strategies--a strategy is one way to meet a need.
We humans tend to get attached to strategies and often assume that the strategy _is_ the need.
However, if you can discover and focus on your needs, it opens possibilities.
Paying attention to needs allows you to look at multiple strategies instead of getting stuck on the first one that pops into your head.
You can evaluate strategies to see which ones are more or less possible, and which ones might meet your needs better.

I've had some very enjoyable consulting experiences,
but I wonder what things might have been like if I had seen and understood the difference between needs and strategies sooner.

If you _do_ want to contribute financially to the book, there are ways:

1. Although the lowest price on Leanpub is `0$` and you are encouraged to use that, it's also possible to raise that number.
2. [Other ways? Contribute to the nonprofit? TBD]

### Creating This Book "In The Open"

A very significant benefit of giving the book away is that I can build it "in the open."
That is, I can publish it on the web as I'm creating it.
This produces:

1. Feedback. My most successful books, _Thinking in C++_ and _Thinking in Java_, were both tested on audiences many times before they were published in print.
   Getting feedback as early as possible, and as the book evolved, was essential in making them what they were.
2. Promotion. People are happy to tell other people about something they like that is free. There's no way to corrupt recommendations if there's no cost.
3. Availability. Giving away _Thinking in Java_ in the late 90's meant that anyone in the world who had an internet connection could get it,
   especially countries where books were expensive or prohibited in some way. And this produced more feedback.


- A "Business Model" can be about more than just money
- My goal is to create experiences. I'm not sure what form they might take, but perhaps it will be helping teams design types and architect their software.

## Yes, I Used AI

This is the first book I've written with AI, and it's been massively helpful.
I've used it every way that I can.
It has dramatically sped up the development of the book and my understanding of the material.

AI has been a tremendously useful assistant, far better than what we've had in the past, but:

1. I've still had to come up with the questions.
2. I've had to check, correct, and rewrite _everything_ it's produced.

To create this book, I've been as lazy as I've known how.
But as with any book, I've developed a deep understanding of the topic by writing it.
And if I've "cheated" by using AI, well, you can use the book for free, so it doesn't bother me.

The Jevons Paradox, named after the English economist William Stanley Jevons, who identified it in 1865.
Jevons observed that as coal use became more efficient, particularly with the invention of the Watt steam engine.
Coal consumption increased rather than decreased.
Increased efficiency in using a resource tends to increase (rather than decrease) the total consumption of that resource.
Rebound effects: expected gains from efficiency are offset by behavioral or economic responses.
As AI makes programmers more efficient in creating systems, the demand for programmers will increase.

I used to have a bookcase full of computer programming books.
Then it became much easier to search the internet for answers than look in books.
Eventually I got rid of most of my books.
It's now become much easier to ask questions of an AI and have it generate examples and prose (although both must be rewritten).
So I will tend to use AI more than other resources, still verifying as I did with those other resources.
Using the AI has taught me to be better at asking questions, and I hope this book might do the same for you.

I've enjoyed writing books, but perhaps because of AI, this will be my last one.
Perhaps I will hand over the teaching of programming to AI.
If that happens, it means that I will have moved on to building tools for programmers and building systems for non-programmers.
Ultimately, that will be more useful than writing books about programming.
I look forward to it.

## Acknowledgements

Most of the understanding I needed to explain this topic came from my attempts to help on the book [Effect-Oriented Programming](https://effectorientedprogramming.com/) with Bill Frasure and James Ward, that we worked on for over four years.
Iâ€™ve also learned a lot from some of the interviews that James and I have done for the [Happy Path Programming podcast](https://happypathprogramming.com/).
