## Introduction to `.pyi` Stub Files

`.pyi` stub files provide type annotations for Python modules, especially useful when source code lacks annotations or is unavailable:

- Contains type definitions without actual implementations.
- Enables static type checking for third-party libraries.

Example:

```python
# math.pyi
def sqrt(x: float) -> float: ...
```

Stub files clearly document expected types, significantly improving interoperability.

## Generating Stubs Automatically with `stubgen`

`stubgen` is a tool included with `mypy` to automatically generate stub files from existing Python code:

### Installation and Basic Use

```bash
pip install mypy
stubgen -m your_module
```

Generates a `.pyi` file with inferred annotations, saving manual effort:

```python
# generated_example.pyi
def greet(name: str) -> str: ...
```

Auto-generated stubs provide a starting point for type annotations.

## Writing Effective Stubs Manually

Manual stub writing is essential when automatic inference is insufficient:

### Example Stub File

```python
# custom_module.pyi
class User:
    id: int
    name: str


def fetch_user(user_id: int) -> User: ...
```

### Best Practices

- Clearly annotate arguments and return types.
- Use ellipsis (`...`) to indicate stub implementation.
- Reflect original module's behavior accurately.

Manual stub files enhance readability and ensure accurate type definitions.

## Distributing and Versioning Typing Stubs

Typing stubs can be distributed independently or alongside the original package:

### Bundled with Package

Include stubs directly in your package:

```
your_package/
├── __init__.py
└── __init__.pyi
```

### Separate Distribution

Publish stubs as standalone packages:

```
pip install types-requests
```

Use semantic versioning aligned with the original package for clarity and compatibility:

```
types-requests==2.25.1
```

Effective versioning ensures seamless integration and updates.

## Typing Third-party Libraries without Native Annotations

When third-party libraries lack native annotations:

### Use Third-party Typing Packages

Install existing typing packages from PyPI:

```bash
pip install types-requests
```

### Custom Stubs

Write custom stub files within your project:

```
stubs/
├── requests.pyi
```

### Ignoring Missing Annotations

Temporarily ignore missing annotations with `mypy` configuration:

```ini
[mypy-requests]
ignore_missing_imports = True
```

Using stubs significantly improves type checking for libraries without built-in annotations, maintaining robust and reliable codebases.
