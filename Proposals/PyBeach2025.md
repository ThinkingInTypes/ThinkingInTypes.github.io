Title: Types and Dataclasses and Enums, Oh My!

Blurb:
The Python type system enables rapid system construction by seamlessly connecting classes and functions.
Mistakes are revealed the moment they happen, without extensive testing (that might not happen).
Combining this with the power of dataclasses and the flexibility of Enums produce clear, robust designs that are quickly implemented.
This example-based presentation shows you how to design and build stubbornly resilient systems that immediately tell you when something is wrong.
Such systems can save large amounts of time and money during development and maintenance.
